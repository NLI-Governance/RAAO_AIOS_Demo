🧠 AI Helper Robustness Roadmap (Multilingual Ready)
------------------------------------------------------

📁 Phase 1: Baseline Validation [ ]
- [ ] Confirm FAISS index loads successfully across systems
- [ ] Validate document chunking and embedding integrity
- [ ] Test default response accuracy across all 10 uploaded policy files
- [ ] Validate correct RAAO logo render on GUIs

📁 Phase 2: Coverage & Comprehension [ ]
- [ ] Identify and log known search gaps (e.g. "HIPPA", "pets")
- [ ] Crosswalk gaps to policy files—validate if they truly exist
- [ ] Add missing FAQs as microchunks into vector index
- [ ] Add synonyms glossary (e.g. "HIPPA" → "HIPAA") file for override referencing

📁 Phase 3: Language Flexibility (Multilingual Prep) [ ]
- [ ] Create policy_synonyms_en.json for English
- [ ] Plan structure for language toggling (e.g., synonyms_fr.json)
- [ ] Validate embeddings in Spanish/French don't degrade performance
- [ ] Add multilingual instructions per GUI page in user's selected language

📁 Phase 4: GUI Integration and Testing [ ]
- [ ] Globally inject AI helper into all employee GUIs
- [ ] Validate microphone support + summarization options
- [ ] Enable fallback to textual guidance if speech fails
- [ ] Re-test GUI performance with updated multilingual assistant

📁 Phase 5: Final QA, Lock, and Demo Prep [ ]
- [ ] Print test responses to “hard” queries (HIPAA, privacy, pets)
- [ ] QA across desktop vs MacBook for sync consistency
- [ ] Finalize Streamlit GUI visual behavior in dark/light mode
- [ ] Prepare multilingual toggle demo for CEO presentation

📝 Notes:
- Glossary/synonym files should be shared across AIOS and ABL
- This roadmap supports printable checkpoints and multilingual scaling
